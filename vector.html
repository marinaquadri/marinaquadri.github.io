    In this project, I wanted to draw my sister, an extraordinary human, an activist for progressive causes, a nature lover who is now pregnant of my niece, Paz (Peace). I also could not think of an easier human figure to draw on Illustrator! She has a very distinctive square face. We grew up together and still have an enormous bond despite being geographically apart for years now.
